Hello!

I'm Shrijanaki Kumar. I am a budding Data Scientist, currently working as a Machine Learning Data Associate at Amazon Development Centre. I completed my undergraduation at PSGR Krishnammal College for women in Commerce with business analytics.

I am also working on my personal projects in my free time with the help of youtube videos and free lectures available online.
I'm currently working on projects in:
 - Python
 - SQL
 - Tableau
 - C
 
I have created repositories for each and you'll find folders with my personal projects and also the projects that i did through the guidance and walkthrough videos. You can also checkout the folders based on the topics I was working on!

I'm currently exploring and trying out the projects that come my way on topics that interest me!
